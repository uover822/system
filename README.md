# The msr microservice demonstration architecture

This is a repository in the microservice demonstration system for
the [Tao of Microservices](//bit.ly/rmtaomicro) book (chapter 9). This
code is live at [msr.com](//msr.com).

This system shows you how to construct a full microservice
architecture. It is MIT licensed so that you can cut-and-paste to
build your own system with minimal effort. The system consists of
multiple repositories, and runs ten or so microservices in production
([Kubernetes](//kubernetes.io)), staging ([Docker](//docker.com)), and
development ([fuge](//github.com/apparatus/fuge)) modes.

The best place to get started is
the [msr](//github.com/msr) repository, which links to
everything else, and has the _Getting Started_ guide.
